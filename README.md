## Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery - Course README

### **Overview:**

The Introduction to Google Cloud BigQuery course is designed to jumpstart exploration of BigQuery, the Google Cloud data warehouse. The course labs direct the learner to use the Google Cloud BigQuery Workspace and Google Cloud Shell, to compose and execute SQL queries. Overall, the course provides context around the role of BigQuery in the observability domain, as well as context around the various SQL operations the learners will perform.

### **Duration:** 
15 min +/-

### **Learning Objectives:** 

By the end of this course, learners should be able to:
* Describe the role that BigQuery plays in the observability domain
* Access Google Cloud BigQuery and Google Cloud Shell
* Execute SQL statements in the Cloud BigQuery Workspace or via Google Cloud Shell
* Create parameterized SQL statements 
* Find additional relevant resources 

### **Prerequisites:** 

* A Google account, to enable free access to BigQuery and the Google Cloud Shell editor  
* Familiarity with SQL (Structured Query Language), to write statements to access BigQuery data 
* Experience with a Unix shell (e.g. bash) command line interface and command set, to write and run shell scripts  

### **Course Activities:** 

Through guided labs, learners will first connect to the BigQuery Workspace and execute SQL commands on preloaded sample table data.  They'll then enable Google Cloud Shell and the bq command-line tool to practice with and become familiar with programmatic SQL approaches to BigQuery data access and management. The final section describes the importance of dynamic SQL and provides a lab for learners to practice parameterizing SQL queries.   

### **Intended Audience:**  
**Data Engineers** and **Data Analysts** who seek a jumpstart with BigQuery, involving hands on SQL practice, plus a tour of the key BigQuery facilities. After taking this course, the learner will be equipped to immediately continue their practice with and exploration of BigQuery.

### **Considerations:** 

Depending on the status of the learner's Google account and their experience with BigQuery, learners may have differing experiences signing up for and connecting to BigQuery and Google Cloud Shell.  In order to activate the free account access to these tools, there must be a billing method associated with the Google account. Learners will not be charged for using these services if they remain within the free use limits.
